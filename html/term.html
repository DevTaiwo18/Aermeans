        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
            that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of
            the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app,
            and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app
            itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
            to it, still belong to Aermeans.</p>
        <p>Aermeans is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
            reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
            We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
            paying for.</p>
        <p>The Aermeans app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service.
            It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
            not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations
            imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
            malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the
            Aermeans app won’t work properly or at all.</p>
        <p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Aermeans will not take responsibility for. Certain
            functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi
            or provided by your mobile network provider, but Aermeans cannot take responsibility for the app not working
            at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement
            with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
            for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party
            charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we
            assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, Aermeans cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
            make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
            Service, Aermeans cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>With respect to Aermeans’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important
            to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely
            on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Aermeans accepts no
            liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
            functionality of the app.</p>
        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the
            requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
            app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Aermeans does
            not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &
            iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
            application when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at
            any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
            (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if
            needed) delete it from your device.</p>

        <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
            periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on
            this page. These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-09-29.</p>
